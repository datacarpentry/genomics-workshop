Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including:
best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command-line
utilities, use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and
perform variant calling, and connecting to and using cloud computing. This workshop is designed to
be taught over two full days of instruction.

**Please note that workshop materials for working with Genomics data in R are in "alpha" development. These lessons are available for review and for informal teaching experiences, but are not yet part of The Carpentries' official lesson offerings.**

Interested in teaching these materials? We have an [onboarding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdutO5tejo) and accompanying [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLlT2lPv32DqCFpRPPdHZBNHiQTpK79wd5Z3nsFwL3s/edit#slide=id.p) available to prepare Instructors to teach these lessons. After watching this video, please contact [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) so that we can record your status as an onboarded Instructor. Instructors who have completed onboarding will be given priority status for teaching at centrally-organized Data Carpentry Genomics workshops.

## Getting Started

This lesson assumes that learners have no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop.
However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
including the
concept of genomic variation within a population. Participants should bring their own laptops and plan to participate actively.

To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](learners/setup.md) tab to
get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

## Data

This workshop uses data from a long term evolution experiment published in 2016: [Tempo and mode of genome evolution in a 50,000-generation experiment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988878/) by Tenaillon O, Barrick JE, Ribeck N, Deatherage DE, Blanchard JL, Dasgupta A, Wu GC, Wielgoss S, Cruveiller S, MÃ©digue C, Schneider D, and Lenski RE. (doi: 10.1038/nature18959)

All of the data used in this workshop can be [downloaded from Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Carpentry_Genomics_beta_2_0/7726454).
